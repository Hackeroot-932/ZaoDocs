  Although OS deployment may sound like a simple task, there are numerous approaches to installing Windows and other operating systems depending on the organization's needs, scale, and specific requirements.
</Callout>

## Introduction to OS Deployment

While typical Windows installations involve completing all installation phases individually on each device, this approach is only practical for small-scale deployments (fewer than 5 computers). For larger deployments—whether in classrooms, offices, government institutions, or for manufacturers preparing devices for worldwide distribution—more efficient methods are required.

When deploying Windows installations across an organization, alternative methods must provide:

<div className="p-4 border rounded-lg bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-900 my-4">
  <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
    <li>Rapid installations</li>
    <li>Customized configurations tailored to organizational needs, such as:</li>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2">
        <li>Preconfigured users and permissions</li>
        <li>Preinstalled drivers</li>
        <li>Preconfigured IP and local network settings</li>
        <li>Preinstalled software</li>
        <li>Other configurations (shortcuts, wallpapers, etc.)</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Hardware-specific optimizations</li>
    <li>Minimal or no technician intervention (unattended installation)</li>
    <li>System cloning without ID duplication conflicts</li>
  </ul>
</div>

The appropriate method depends on the desired outcome. Let's examine the Windows installation phases, using Windows 7 as a reference due to its simplicity for demonstration purposes.

## 1. Windows Installation Phases

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <h4>WindowsPE (WinPE) Phase</h4>
    <p>During this initial phase, installation starts from external media (DVD, USB, etc.) and requires the following selections:</p>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
      <li>Installation language</li>
      <li>Sometimes, the "edition" to install (Home, Professional, Ultimate, etc.)</li>
      <li>Depending on the version, accepting the End User License Agreement (EULA)</li>
      <li>Installation type: Standard or Advanced</li>
      <li>With advanced installation, the final destination for Windows: hard drive, partition scheme, target partition, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once these parameters are selected, the file copying and decompression phase begins, concluding the first phase. The Windows "image" is copied—the operating system without modifications, as released by Microsoft.</p>
    <p>Note: In unattended installations, this phase can also be used to:</p>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
      <li>Execute specific commands during Windows installation</li>
      <li>Automate the insertion of the Windows license key</li>
      <li>Activate the administrator user and configure a predefined password</li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <h4>OfflineServicing Phase</h4>
    <p>This phase occurs just before the first restart and is designed primarily for authorized OS distributors who want to add components necessary for their equipment or offer improvements, additions, or brand-specific customizations:</p>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
      <li>Language packs</li>
      <li>Updates</li>
      <li>Device drivers</li>
      <li>Other offline packages</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Therefore, if you have an OEM Windows DVD/ISO provided with a device purchase, the first modification to the Windows "image" occurs during this phase. When using the official Windows DVD/ISO, nothing happens during this phase.</p>
    <p>It's also possible that you've used software to manipulate Windows installations and have an ISO that utilizes this installation phase for something similar to what was mentioned above.</p>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <h4>Specialize Phase</h4>
    <p>This phase occurs after the first restart and configures the Windows image specifically for the hardware on which Windows is being installed. Windows adapts to the hardware on which it will run.</p>
    <p>Security IDs (SIDs) are also created, enabling subsequent authentication of user accounts, groups, or any other system entity with associated security.</p>
    <p>During this phase, distributors can configure certain Windows features without user intervention:</p>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
      <li>Network configuration</li>
      <li>Regional options (time zone, keyboard, number formats, etc.)</li>
      <li>Domain information</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Distributors can also specify Internet Explorer's home page for immediate access to the brand's website or, in an organization/company, to direct users to the desired department or branch website.</p>
    <p>This phase continues until the second restart and even a bit further, right up to the point where a user account needs to be configured.</p>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <h4>OoBE (Out of Box Experience) Phase</h4>
    <p>This phase occurs after the second restart and is what a user would see for the first time after purchasing a computer with Windows pre-installed. Hence, it's called "Out of Box Experience" (OoBE).</p>
    <p>During this phase, Windows undergoes final configuration. Users installing from the official DVD configure options that distributors could have preconfigured in the Specialize phase:</p>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
      <li>Network configuration</li>
      <li>Regional options (time zone, keyboard, number formats, etc.)</li>
      <li>Domain information</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additionally, and most importantly, this is the phase where the user account for the first login is created, which will have administrative permissions in Windows.</p>
    <p>When the OoBE phase ends, the newly created user account is configured with the system's default options for new users, and the Desktop is displayed.</p>

    </div>
</Steps>

## 2. Audit Mode Windows Installation

<Callout type="info">
  Audit Mode allows OEMs and system administrators to customize Windows before delivering it to the end user. This mode bypasses OOBE to permit configuration and software installations without creating user accounts.
</Callout>

<div className="p-4 border rounded-lg bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-900 my-4">
  <p>As we've seen in the first section, a normal installation goes through 4 phases (WinPE, OfflineServicing, Specialize, and OoBE). However, after the Specialize phase and before beginning the OoBE phase, there's an option to take a different path and continue installation in audit mode.</p>
  
  <p>To do this, press Ctrl+Shift+F3 before entering the OoBE phase. This action restarts the computer and boots directly to the Desktop.</p>

  <div className="flex justify-center my-4">
    <img src="/audit-mode.webp" alt="Audit Mode in Windows Installation" className="rounded-lg shadow-md" />
  </div>
</div>

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Using Audit Mode">
    <p>Audit mode allows us to preconfigure the system so that when it's delivered to a customer and started for the first time, the first thing they see is the OoBE phase. After configuring their username, password, etc., they ultimately receive a customized Windows with preinstalled software or predefined configurations.</p>
    
    <p>This is what all laptop manufacturers do with those "wonderful things" they include when we buy a new device, including:</p>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
      <li>Drivers for specific hardware exclusive to the manufacturer</li>
      <li>Manufacturer's software that is supposedly "super useful and necessary"</li>
      <li>Trial versions of Office, antivirus, etc.</li>
      <li>Games of questionable origin and purpose</li>
      <li>Wallpapers, customizations, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Working in Audit Mode">
    <p>When we boot in audit mode and reach the Windows Desktop, we can observe several things:</p>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
      <li>A window appears for a program called "Sysprep". If this window is accidentally closed, it's possible to access the program's location by navigating to C:\Windows\System32\sysprep, or by running Win+R → sysprep.</li>
      <li>Opening the start menu reveals that we're using the "Administrator" account, and no other user accounts exist in the system.</li>
      <li>Everything runs with administrator permissions, and if we install anything or open CMD, it does so with administrator permissions without prompting us.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>In other words... we've completely skipped the OoBE phase and are in a system where we have absolute (or near-absolute) permissions.</p>
    
    <p>The Sysprep window allows us to choose the mode in which the system will boot after an eventual restart or shutdown: OoBE or audit.</p>
    
    <p>Since some programs will request a restart after installation, it's necessary to use this program so that we can return to audit mode after restarting and continue installing everything that's needed.</p>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Finalizing Audit Mode">
    <p>Once configuration is complete, we'll choose in the Sysprep window that after shutdown or restart, the OoBE phase should execute.</p>
    
    <p>Additionally, we can request to generalize the Windows image, which would revert the installation to the Specialize phase, rather than starting in the OoBE phase. This allows bringing the pre-installation done in audit mode to other computers that don't have the same hardware components.</p>
    
    <p>After choosing the restart/shutdown mode (or whether to generalize the image), Sysprep prepares the system to start in the OoBE or Specialize phase, cleaning up any necessary files. This way, no trace remains of what was done in audit mode, and the customer thinks that what they see is truly the first boot of the system.</p>
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## 3. Unattended Windows (and Linux) Installation

<Callout type="warning">
  A fully unattended installation can destroy existing disk content to repartition it, so it's not always the most suitable solution. Consider creating "mostly unattended" installations that allow configuration of critical elements like edition selection and destination drive.
</Callout>

<Tabs items={["Introduction", "Windows Solutions", "Linux Solutions", "Third-Party Tools"]}>
  <Tab>
    <p>A normal installation requires attention from the user or technician at several points, such as:</p>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
      <li>Installation language selection and keyboard configuration</li>
      <li>OS edition selection, if possible (Home/Pro, Desktop/Server, etc.)</li>
      <li>End-user license agreement (EULA) acceptance</li>
      <li>Installation destination or partitioning selection</li>
      <li>License key entry</li>
      <li>Regional configuration (time zone, date/time format, currency, etc.)</li>
      <li>Network configuration</li>
      <li>Primary user account creation</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>A fully unattended installation has preconfigured answers to all these configurations so that installation requires no user intervention.</p>
    
    <p>Thus, a "full unattended" installation might consist solely of booting from external media (flash drive, DVD, external HDD, etc.) and leaving the computer for however long necessary until everything finishes. After this time, we would find the OS desktop fully functional.</p>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab>
    <p>In Windows, the answer list is stored in XML format in the AutoUnattend.xml file, located at the root of the installation media.</p>
    
    <p>Microsoft provides automation kits for companies using these methods, specific to each Windows version, such as Windows AIK for Windows 7 or Windows ADK for Windows 10 and 11. These kits include a program called Windows System Image Manager (WSIM), which makes it easier to create and validate the AutoUnattend.xml file.</p>
    
    <div className="flex justify-center my-4">
      <img src="/windows-adk.jpg" alt="Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit" className="rounded-lg shadow-md" /> 
    </div>
    <div className="flex justify-center my-4">
      <img src="/windows-adk-2.jpg" alt="Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit" className="rounded-lg shadow-md" />
    </div>    
    
    <p>Microsoft also offers a tool based on Windows ADK called Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) that automates installations across different Windows versions, from Windows 7 to Windows 11.</p>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab>
    <p>Unattended installations aren't exclusive to Windows. Some Linux distributions support this through the Kickstart file/method. This method is typically used in enterprise-type distributions, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), but other distributions also allow it and even facilitate it through tools to generate this file, like Cobbler.</p>
    
    <div className="flex justify-center my-4">
      <img src="/kickstart.png" alt="Linux Kickstart Installation" className="rounded-lg shadow-md" />
    </div>
    
    <p>The Kickstart file contains all the answers to questions that would normally be asked during installation, such as:</p>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
      <li>Language and keyboard layout</li>
      <li>Time zone</li>
      <li>Root password</li>
      <li>Disk partitioning scheme</li>
      <li>Package selection</li>
      <li>Network configuration</li>
    </ul>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab>
    <p>Third-party tools exist for creating unattended installations that go far beyond what has been described, allowing customization of whether to install or not install certain Windows components that generate rejection (Cortana, Edge, etc.), whether to integrate drivers or updates, whether to activate or deactivate services, or whether to also install third-party software that has silent installers, whether to configure hundreds (or thousands) of Windows settings, etc.</p>
    
    <p>This makes the unattended installation creation phase lengthy (or even eternal), but the installation and configuration phase minimal. And if installation needs to be done on hundreds of computers, it's ultimately like other scenarios: it's advisable to invest more time in planning if you want to save time in execution.</p>
    
    <p>Some of these tools include:</p>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
      <li>nLite for Windows 2000, XP, and 2003</li>
      <li>vLite for Windows Vista</li>
      <li>RT 7 Lite or RT Seven Lite for Windows 7</li>
      <li>Win Toolkit for various Windows versions</li>
      <li>MSMG Toolkit for various Windows versions</li>
      <li>NTLite for Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10, and 11</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Although not the only one capable of this, another interesting feature of NTLite is that it allows modifying a running system to remove unwanted components that cannot be uninstalled by other means.</p>

## 4. OS Cloning

<Callout type="info">
  Cloning offers an alternative deployment method that's often independent of the computer and OS, creating identical disk copies that can be transferred to similar hardware.
</Callout>

<div className="p-4 border rounded-lg bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-900 my-4">
  <p>What we've seen so far in this topic has focused mainly on Windows and would help us deploy Windows systems across an organization's computers.</p>
  
  <p>However, there's another way to deploy that's usually independent of the computer and OS (although this isn't always the case): cloning.</p>
  
  <p>The cloning process involves obtaining identical hard drives, so that if an OS, Dual Boot, or Triple Boot is working on one computer, cloning the disk and transferring it to another similar computer will also work and function the same way as the original copy.</p>
</div>

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Cloning Variants">
    <h4>Clone Identicalness Degree</h4>
    <p>Some programs generate clones with exactly the same content, without further considerations, but others offer the possibility of making identical or forensic copies. This type of copy is performed sector by sector, such that not only is the content cloned, but also the position of each file block on the disk, sometimes including blocks considered empty (but containing information). For example, these types of clones are used as expert evidence in trials.</p>
    
    <h4>Cloning Methods</h4>
    <p>The cloning process can be part of a larger objective: backup & restore. It's apparent that if a backup is made of an entire disk and the backup is restored to another disk, ultimately a cloned disk is obtained from the first one.</p>
    
    <h4>Backup Types</h4>
    <p>At this point, it would be worthwhile to discuss backup types, although they're not strictly related to cloning:</p>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
      <li><strong>Full backup:</strong> Involves copying all data.</li>
      <li><strong>Differential backup:</strong> Done when a full backup already exists, involves copying only data that is new or has been modified since the last full backup.</li>
      <li><strong>Incremental backup:</strong> Done when a full backup already exists, involves copying only data that is new or has been modified since the last backup, whether it's a full, differential, or incremental backup. These types of backups are typically done regularly, so that, for example, an organization might have a policy to make a full backup on the 1st of each month and make incremental backups every day, or every hour, to avoid losing data considered vitally important.</li>
    </ul>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Cloning Software Approaches">
    <p>Regarding how to perform this backup process, there are programs so specific to backup that to perform cloning, first, a backup must be obtained in a file (which uses compression to save space), and then that file must be restored to another disk. This file is usually called an "image" if its purpose is cloning.</p>
    
    <p>Other programs can perform "on-the-fly" cloning, copying data from one disk to another without generating any file.</p>
    
    <p>The first type of program would allow generating the disk image and making copies at another time, without having the original disk, and also carrying the image on a flash drive to other organization facilities, without having to open the computers.</p>
    
    <p>The second type of program would allow making clones at specific times without generating a large file (gigabytes) or having to store it.</p>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Network Deployment Types">
    <p>To avoid having to carry an image from computer to computer (first type of program), or having to open computers to make clones (second type of program), there are also programs that can make these copies and restorations over the network.</p>
    
    <p>Some programs allow creating connections between any 2 clients (computers) on a network (peer-to-peer or "P2P" connections) so that the backup stored on one client can be used to clone a disk on the other client.</p>
    
    <p>Other programs have implemented a client-server architecture, such that a version of the backup program with server capabilities is installed on a network computer (obviously, this is usually done on a server), and an ordinary version of the program is installed on all network clients, so that connections are from a client to the server. Thus, any computer could restore a copy stored on the server, but there would be no connections between clients.</p>
  </Accordion>

## 5. Linux Deployment Methods

<Callout type="info">
  Linux distributions offer powerful, flexible, and often free deployment solutions that are especially valuable in enterprise environments, educational institutions, and organizations with budget constraints.
